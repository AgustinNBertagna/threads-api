# Threads API - Reverse Engineering

### [Threads](https://threads.net) REST API created from scratch with BunJS runtime and Elysia Web Framework.

At the moment the app is still on development and not deployed.

To start the app, run:

```sh
bun run dev
```

There are serveral endpoints to test: Including users, posts, search and even random feed with country params.

The server runs on port 3000. So be sure you don't have any other services running on it.

## TODOS:

- ### Refactoring
- ### Docs
- ### Deploy
